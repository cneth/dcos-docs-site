- Changed `dcos-zk backup` and `dcos-zk restore` to exit early if ZooKeeper is running. (DCOS_OSS-5353)
- DC/OS Net: Fix support for big sets in the IPset manager. (DCOS-57506, COPS-5229)
- Added new diagnostic REST API bundle with performance improvements. (DCOS_OSS-5098)
- Fixed old diagnostics bundle from increasing diagnostics job duration when job was done. (DCOS_OSS-5494)
- Updated DC/OS installation to not create `nobody` Linux user group on the hosts. (COPS-5220, DCOS-59427) 
- Increased number of diagnostics fetchers. (DCOS-51483) 
- Fixed DC/OS overlay networks update comparison to use all fields. (DCOS_OSS-5620)
- All agent VTEP IPs reserve when recovering from replicated log. (DCOS_OSS-5626)
- Set network interfaces as unmanaged for networkd only on CoreOS, which fixes an issue that could prevent the overlay network from working properly in some situations.(COPS-5575, DCOS-60956)
- Fixed DC/OS clients that do not adhere to Exhibitor TLS. (DCOS-57704)	
- Fixed configuration updates for DC/OS 1.12.5 (DCOS-55360)
- Changed dcos-e2e version to get higher log retention in 1.12, 1.13 and master branches. (DCOS-58001)	
- Fixed incorrect dcos-diagnostics HTTP response status codes for GET/DELETE. (DCOS-58105)

- The time it takes to deploy a service with a L4-VIP has been reduced by pruning VIPs, which reduced growth of state messages exchanged among dcos-net processes.  (DCOS-56071, DCOS_OSS-5356)
- You can now delete a service endpoint via Form. (DCOS-21472) 
- You can now save Docker parameters, as expected. (DCOS-45226)
- Fixed TypeError in ResourcesUtil.getAvailableResources (DCOS-46307)

- DC/OS now supports DESTROY_RAW_DISK authorization action. (DCOS-50932)
- Under heavy load, direct requests to the IAM could be slowed down, making the IAM slow to respond to all requests. Mesos master now uses a login endpoint that goes through Admin Router, reducing the effect of any slow senders. This addresses a rare error condition in which the IAM system can become unavailable, potentially leading to Mesos task launch errors in the strict security mode. (DCOS-56053)

- Added correct icons for services that are installed from Universe, but are not classified as Frameworks. (COPS-4727)
- The time it takes to deploy a service with an L4-VIP has been reduced by pruning VIPs, which reduced growth of state messages exchanged among dcos-net processes. (COPS-5081)
